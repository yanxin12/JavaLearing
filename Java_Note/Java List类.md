# Java List类

```
/**
 * An ordered collection (also known as a <i>sequence</i>).  The user of this
 * interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
 * inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
 * the list), and search for elements in the list.<p>
 *
 // List结构数据允许重复元素而set结构数据不允许重复数据
 * Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
 * lists typically allow pairs of elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt>
 * such that <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt>, and they typically allow multiple
 * null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
 * that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
 * throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
 * expect this usage to be rare.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * specified in the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of the
 * <tt>iterator</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
 * access to list elements.  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note
 * that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
 * for some implementations (the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class, for
 * example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
 * preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
 * implementation.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides a special iterator, called a
 * <tt>ListIterator</tt>, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
 * bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the
 * <tt>Iterator</tt> interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
 * list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to search for a specified
 * object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
 * caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear
 * searches.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
 * remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.<p>
 *
 * Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,
 * extreme caution is advised: the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>
 * methods are no longer well defined on such a list.
 *
 * <p>Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements in this list

## 1 sort方法

```java
 /**
     * Sorts this list according to the order induced by the specified
     * {@link Comparator}.
     *
     * <p>All elements in this list must be <i>mutually comparable</i> using the
     * specified comparator (that is, {@code c.compare(e1, e2)} must not throw
     * a {@code ClassCastException} for any elements {@code e1} and {@code e2}
     * in the list).
     *
     * <p>If the specified comparator is {@code null} then all elements in this
     * list must implement the {@link Comparable} interface and the elements'
     * {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} should be used.
     *
     * <p>This list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable.
     *
     * @implSpec
     * The default implementation obtains an array containing all elements in
     * this list, sorts the array, and iterates over this list resetting each
     * element from the corresponding position in the array. (This avoids the
     * n<sup>2</sup> log(n) performance that would result from attempting
     * to sort a linked list in place.)
     *
     * @implNote
     * This implementation is a stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that
     * requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons when the input array is
     * partially sorted, while offering the performance of a traditional
     * mergesort when the input array is randomly ordered.  If the input array
     * is nearly sorted, the implementation requires approximately n
     * comparisons.  Temporary storage requirements vary from a small constant
     * for nearly sorted input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly
     * ordered input arrays.
     *
     * <p>The implementation takes equal advantage of ascending and
     * descending order in its input array, and can take advantage of
     * ascending and descending order in different parts of the same
     * input array.  It is well-suited to merging two or more sorted arrays:
     * simply concatenate the arrays and sort the resulting array.
     *
     * <p>The implementation was adapted from Tim Peters's list sort for Python
     * (<a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt">
     * TimSort</a>).  It uses techniques from Peter McIlroy's "Optimistic
     * Sorting and Information Theoretic Complexity", in Proceedings of the
     * Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp 467-474,
     * January 1993.
     *
     * @param c the {@code Comparator} used to compare list elements.
     *          A {@code null} value indicates that the elements'
     *          {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} should be used
     * @throws ClassCastException if the list contains elements that are not
     *         <i>mutually comparable</i> using the specified comparator
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the list's list-iterator does
     *         not support the {@code set} operation
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException
     *         (<a href="Collection.html#optional-restrictions">optional</a>)
     *         if the comparator is found to violate the {@link Comparator}
     *         contract
     * @since 1.8
